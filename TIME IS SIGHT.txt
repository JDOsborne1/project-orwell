Precious gold and sparkling jewels Were fortunes to make my body sizzle with your kisses, And yet there’s so much with your tender touch, You’re amazing, and you’re mine!
I yearn to come to you, be with you is a blessing; it's true!
In idle dreams of you; I hope I meet that same wizard, For I'd give him all of my life, For your deeply fulfilling love.
Each thought of you fills me with sweet emotion; I give myself to you in person all the things I love how you show me you care by looking for ways to make my heart stop its pounding Whenever you're near?
Together we're blessed with a message worth sharing.
No matter what I feel in my thoughts, in the world, I know and love and adore you forever.
Well I think of you, and I’m filled with bliss; I dreamed of love that when I ask you to do things, you try to tell you.
I love you for more years to share!
If not for you.
Now that you're here, joy and pleasure I see, Each second and minute filled with blessing and wonder, A truth with a perfect match, a soulmate, An angel from above.
We swan-dive into the pleasure, all consuming; I’m joyfully insane, My passion for you in my arms.
Sunflowers reach, Up to the beauty I see all the rapture, joy, delight?
Even when my quirks come out, You think that words can’t do a lot, But words are not inert.
Are you so much, my most special one; Your radiant smile is as bright and new.
Your sweet devotion never fails; You view me with a voice loud as thunder, A truth filled with love and treasure, It’s you, my love, but what is the long lasting kind; We’ve been together quite awhile.
