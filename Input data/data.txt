In idle dreams of long ago,
I imagined my true love
A perfect match, a soulmate,
An angel from above.

Now you’re here, and now I know
Our love will stay and thrive and grow.

I never knew about happiness
I didn’t think dreams came true
I couldn’t really believe in love,
Until I finally met you.

If I could have all the time in the world,
I know what I would do:
I’d spend the time
In pleasure sublime,
Just by being with you.

Each thought of you fills me with sweet emotion
I give to you my deepest devotion.
My fondest wishes you completely fulfill
I love you totally, and I always will.

Of everything I know and love and treasure,
It’s you, my love, who gives me perfect pleasure.
I love your way with me, your touch, your kiss
To be with you is happiness and bliss.

When all goes wrong, and my life runs amok,
I think of you, and I get unstuck
In the midst of chaos, you make my heart sing
You’re my peace, my happiness, my everything.

If tomorrow my life were finished,
With many fun things left to do,
It wouldn't matter at all,
Because, my love, I had you.

Your femininity/masculinity attracts me
Your steady strength supports me
Your tenderness sustains me
You’re the perfect love for me.

When life is cold,
I wrap myself in your warmth,
nestled in your love,
my perfect refuge.

It’s crazy, but you’re all I want and need
You win I’m yours forever I concede.

I say a prayer of thanks each day
To the good Lord up above:
Thanks for the gift of you in my life,
For your deeply fulfilling love.

Life without you was fine, was okay.
It was spent aimlessly, getting through each new day.
Now that you're here, joy and pleasure I see,
Each second and minute filled with sweet ecstasy.

I loved you then,
And I love you still
I adore you now,
And I always will.

Happy, full and rich is my life
Contentment is all I see.
Why all the rapture, joy, delight?
It’s simply because you love me.

I’ve held others before,
But it was never like this,
Where my body inhales you
And quivers with bliss,

Where my senses are reeling
From the strength of desire,
And if I can’t have you soon,
I’ll be consumed by the fire.

If not for you, I wouldn’t know
What true love really meant.
I’d never feel this inner peace
I couldn’t be content.

If not for you, I’d never have
The pleasures of romance.
I’d miss the bliss, the craziness,
Of love’s sweet, silly dance.

I have to feel your tender touch
I have to hear your voice
No other one could take your place
You’re it I have no choice.

If not for you, I’d be adrift
I don’t know what I’d do
I’d be searching for my other half,
Incomplete, if not for you.

We swan-dive into the volcano, burning
We’re creatures of the fire,
Mingled male and female, yearning
For the heat, the sweet explosion of desire.

I splash into the pleasure, all consuming
I’m joyfully insane,
My passion for you deep, and fully blooming
Long after, sweet warm flickers still remain.

You make my body sizzle with your kisses,
And yet there’s so much more
My heart is kindled, too It knows what bliss is,
This closeness that I’ve never felt before.

My body and my heart belong to you
I’m peaceful and complete.
I see more adventures coming for we two,
We creatures of the tender fire and heat.

Before I met you,
I thought I was happy,
and I was,
but I had never known
the rich contentment,
deep satisfaction,
and total fulfillment
you brought to me
when you came into my life.
Before I met you,
I felt a lot of things,
good things,
but I had never experienced
the indescribably intense
feelings I have for you.
Before I met you,
I thought I knew myself,
and I did,
but you looked deep inside me
and found fresh new things
for us to share.
Before I met you,
I thought I knew about love,
but I didn’t,
until I met you.

Let me sing you a love song
About what I feel in my heart
Butterflies can't find nectar
Whenever we're apart.

You're a flower in bloom.
In the dark, in the gloom,
It's you who brightens my day.
How many ways do I need you?
Every day, every way, come what may.

Our love is the long lasting kind
We’ve been together quite awhile.
I love you for so many things,
Your voice, your touch, your kiss, your smile.

You accept me as I am
I can relax and just be me.
Even when my quirks come out,
You think they’re cute you let me be.

With you, there’s nothing to resist
You’re irresistible to me.
I’m drawn to you in total trust
I give myself to you willingly.

Your sweet devotion never fails
You view me with a patient heart.
You love me, dear, no matter what.
You’ve been that way right from the start.

Those are just a few reasons why
I’ll always love you like I do.
We’ll have a lifetime full of love,
And it will happen because of you.

You're one in a million, my most special one
Your radiant smile is as bright as the sun
You're smart and caring and have many great charms,
And my heart really sings when you're wrapped in my arms.

I'm happy you chose me from all of the rest,
And I'm proud 'cause I know that I got the best.
You're so cute and sweet, and you glow like a pearl
I just love you so much, my most wonderful girl!

When you’re away from me
I long for you...
in my thoughts,
in the center of my soul.
I yearn to see
the affection in your eyes...
blue depths of love for me.
I crave the safe warmth
of your arms around me...
my cave of comfort, ease and peace.
My body aches with hunger for you...
the exquisite torture
of delayed ecstasy,
coming soon, coming soon.
I long for you, I yearn for you,
I ache for you...
Please, bring all that I crave
in your incomparable self.
Come to me. Come to me.

How did this miracle happen
That we're so very blessed,
So close…and more contented,
Than I ever would have guessed.

I never thought that I
Could spend each precious minute
With just one special person
And find happiness within it.

I've learned so much from you
About loving, sharing, giving
I know if I hadn't met you,
I wouldn't be really living.

We're facing life together
We're handling joy and sorrow
I'm glad you're on my side,
Whatever comes tomorrow.

You're my perfect partner,
Sweet lover, trusted friend.
We're safe within our love,
A love that will never end.

I love you for the warm, sweet affection
in your eyes
whenever you look at me,
and the special smile
you save only for me.
I love that you always seek
to have your body close to mine,
reaching out to touch,
to hold my hand,
to wrap your arms around me.
I love how you show me you care
by looking for ways
to make my life easier and more comfortable.
I love that when I ask you to do things,
you try to do them
instead of thinking me demanding.
I love that your favorite place is near me,
that you’d rather be with me
than anywhere else.
I love you for more reasons
than this page has space to write,
so I’ll try to tell you and show you in person
all the things I love about you.

No matter what I look like,
Whether pretty or plain you see,
When I’m all dressed up or in PJs,
You just keep on loving me.

Sometimes I’m happy and cheerful
Other times grumpy and sad
Your absolute love never wavers,
Whether I’m grouchy or glad.

Sometimes I try to change you
And sometimes I criticize
But I feel something melting within me,
When I see all the love in your eyes.

Your tolerance is endless,
However I choose to be
Having my love makes you happy,
So you just keep on loving me.

And that is why, my darling,
Whatever else I do,
One thing is sure no matter what,
I’ll just keep on loving you.

I had many loves before I met you,
interesting loves,
companionable, fun-loving,
comfortable loves,
but only one real love, unique love...
like you.
No one made my heart pound,
my skin damp, everything juicy
through and through...
like you.
None left me breathless,
panting with excitement,
satisfaction, and finally peace,
like you.
Before you, there were others,
but none captured
my mind, heart and soul forever...
like you.

No one loves me like you do
I’ve never felt like this
You please me in so many ways,
With a word, a caress, a kiss.

No one understands me like you do
You see me deep inside,
You choose to overlook my flaws,
The ones I try to hide.

No one satisfies me like you do,
When our bodies intertwine
You give so much with your tender touch,
You’re amazing, and you’re mine!

No one loves me like you do
You fill my every need,
And that is why, my darling,
I’ll follow wherever you lead.

I always yearn to come to you,
be with you,
connect with you,
unite with you,
merge with you.
I always love to nurture you,
nourish you,
meet your needs,
feed your hungers.
I will always cherish you,
treasure you,
adore you.
I aways want to be yours,
always.

When I think of you, you fill my mind
There’s no more thinking room I find.
I’ve never had such thoughts before
I’m lost in you, whom I adore.

I think no more of mundane things,
Like common pleasures that living brings.
I just think of you, and I’m filled with dreams
To keep your love fills all my schemes.

How could anyone ever know,
The sweet dreams that I dreamt as a youth,
Could blossom and focus and grow,
Until now they’d turn up as a truth.

A truth filled with blessing and wonder,
A truth filled with love and with caring,
A truth with a voice loud as thunder,
A truth with a message worth sharing.

For you, my love, filled all my dreams,
Of a life I thought never could be.
Now with you at my side, I’m contented
For my dreaming came true, don’t you see?

I never gave up on my dreaming,
I persisted because I just knew,
A wait for real love is worth waiting,
Now you’re here, and my dreams have come true.

Sometimes a man’s mind and tongue
seem disconnected.
My mind realizes your wonderfulness,
but my tongue might fail to tell you.
Maybe, since my eyes and brain
see how very obvious
your lovely, endearing qualities are,
my tongue thinks
I don’t need to let you know.
In case there is any doubt
about what I am thinking and feeling,
I am writing it down for you:
I always think
you are the prettiest, smartest,
most wonderful, kindest,
most loveable girl
in all the world.
I want to hug, kiss, love
and adore you forever.
Please try to have patience
with the negligence of my tongue.
I am working to keep it in the loop better.

My thoughts of you are like raindrops on flowers...
Beautiful.
My thoughts of you are like a rainbow at a splashing waterfall...
Beautiful.
My thoughts of you are like a full moon
shining through a cloudy night sky...
Beautiful.
No matter what wonders my eyes have seen,
Nothing compares to the beauty I see
when I look at you.
My love for you is beautiful.

We all are explorers on the great sea of life
We search and we hunt for our pleasure.
Some adventures are fruitful, and some disappoint,
But few find a gem they can treasure.

I’m so blessed I found you as my priceless prize
You’re a treasure in every way.
I searched with the rest and discovered the best
Finding you was my luckiest day.

What is it about you that makes me feel weak,
And gives me the goose bumps whenever you speak?
Why does the sight of you fill me with pleasure,
Like a spotlight that shines on a glorious treasure?

Are you so different from others I’ve known?
What qualities do you have that are yours alone?
What can it be that fills up my heart?
And makes me feel lost whenever we part?

There’s no easy answer for this marvelous bliss,
For the wonder I feel whenever we kiss,
For the fire that rages at the touch of your skin,
For the way my heart pounds for you way deep within.

It must be the power of love that I feel,
That ties me in bonds that seem strong as steel.
I could fight to get loose, but I’d rather give in
To stay trapped by your charms is how I will win.

While others tell me I have faults and flaws,
And pick me all apart and criticize,
You love me, sweetheart, just the way I am
I only see affection in your eyes.

My pesky quirks you only find endearing
Your perfect mate is what you choose to see
I love you for a multitude of reasons
And most of all 'cause you let me be me.

I never have to change to meet your standards
Acceptance is the greatest gift you give
I appreciate you for your sweet devotion,
And I’ll love you for as long as we shall live.

Pirates bold in days of old
Searched the world for treasure rare,
But none they found as bright and sound,
As my girl with the reddish hair.

Precious gold and sparkling jewels
Were fortunes to make men care,
But none were worth a penny
Next to my girl with the reddish hair.

These pirates fought and died for wealth
Their lives I wouldn’t share,
For I have the only wealth I need:
My girl with the reddish hair.

I was self sufficient,
gratified by my independence,
alone, but not lonely,
I thought.
But I was restless,
searching blindly for something
to fill an empty place
I didn't even know I had,
dimly aware
that I was somehow unfinished.
Then you came,
and filled everything,
every space, every need,
even secret dreams
I had concealed from myself.
I was self sufficient,
and restless
Now I am profoundly peaceful
and complete,
because of you.

There's a story told of a wizard
Who, for money, would cast a spell,
And I'm sure that you met this wizard,
And you, his wares he did sell.

What else can explain how your smile
Can make my heartbeat roar,
Or how your look slows my breathing,
While causing my spirits to soar.

I'm sure that you and this wizard
Conspired to control my brain,
For I'm always thinking about you--
Feeling happy and slightly insane.

Now I hope I meet that same wizard,
For I'd give him all of my gold,
To make you want to stay with me,
And share happiness as we grow old.

I've had a dream, since I was young
Of just how life should be,
But through the years, try as I might,
That dream eluded me.

I dreamed of a life that was filled with bliss
I dreamed of love and sharing.
I dreamed, imagined and creatively planned
An adventure for two who were caring.

The road to today was paved with the dreams
That slowly got ground to dust.
And I've trudged that road and carried my load
And tried very hard to adjust.

Each step made me stronger each test made me wiser,
So on my long walk, I grew,
Till the time was right, one magical night,
For the road to make room for two.

Now my brain shouts your name, and your loving reply
Makes a place for you in my heart.
(Name), it cries--so tender, so wise--
Let's make the adventure start!

Together we're blessed with a perfect match,
Something that's bright and new.
It's not too late, so let's create
A life that makes dreams come true.

My thoughts of you come frequently
They’re always filled with you and me.
No matter what I see or when,
It brings you back to mind again.

I’d be sitting, reading a book,
Or be out walking by a brook
No matter what the path I took,
I’d see dream images of how you look.

Each day is filled with dreams of you
I hope that all these dreams come true.

When love strikes us hard and makes mush of our brain,
When love sneaks in and makes us insane,
All sense can depart and leave the brain blank,
When love like that strikes it can drain our whole tank.

So beware of the power you exert over me,
For I’m under your spell that’s clear as can be.
Whenever you’re near, my brain slips out of joint
I fight my love, but what is the point?

You’re my strength and my weakness, for I love you so dearly,
And I hope our love shines through the years just as clearly.

You're the love of my life, my sweet, wonderful wife,
And that's what you'll always be.
I can hardly believe the good fortune I've had
Through the years since you married me.

Each year spent with you is a blessing it's true!
Each year brings contentment so rare
Each year binds us stronger and deeper in love,
and my wish is for more years to share!

I see you at school
And you glance my way,
Passing in the halls
In your ordinary day.

But anytime
Your eyes meet mine
Is a day so rare,
A day so fine.

Just another face,
I’m nothing to you
You look but don’t see
You haven’t a clue...

That my heart is racing
I’m trembling inside
So much love for you
I’m trying to hide.

You smile at others
You pass me by
I’m invisible,
And I want to cry.

You say that you like me,
But that we're just friends
Can I feel the same?
Well I think it depends:

Can I quit breathing fast
Each time you appear?
Will my heart stop its pounding
Whenever you're near?

I'd like to feel nothing,
And get rid of the thrill.
I wish I'd stop loving you,
But I don't think I will.

I pray the Lord will bless you, Love,
With all that’s good from heaven above.
Lord, please keep him well, secure
Create in us a love that’s pure,
Unselfish, giving, fond and true,
Fixed on loving and serving You.

When love first comes and all seems right
It’s beyond our reason that we two can fight.
Yet fights will come, and anger might thrive,
So let’s try to be sure that our love will survive.

Let’s make our plans with similar goals,
So our wants and desires won’t hit hidden shoals
That set us crashing when things get hard,
So our love can stay strong even when it gets jarred.

For if love can stay strong when it’s tested by fire,
Then we'd share a future that most would admire,
A future where partners would strive side by side,
A future where love would always abide.

For many years we’ve lived and loved,
Our lives a rich delight.
Then one day’s events caused us to clash,
And the friction led to a fight.

You think that words can’t do a lot,
But words are not inert.
Words have the power to sooth and calm,
But can also cut and hurt.

If thoughts are kept within your head,
They can be dealt with by you alone.
But once the words are past your lips,
They’re like a monument carved in stone.

So always take the time to think,
Of the hurt that can take place,
Whenever a thought is hastily said,
To cause someone loss of face.

It’s hard work to tear the monument down,
To make the hurtful words lose their power.
It’s so much better not to speak the thought,
And just complain to yourself for an hour.

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Your reading is amusing,
And so are you.

Orchids are white,
Ghost ones are rare,
Your bag is brown,
And so is your hair.

Magnolia grows,
With buds like eggs,
Your functioning is smooth,
And so are your legs.

Sunflowers reach,
Up to the skies,
Your sky is grey,
And so are your eyes.

Foxgloves in hedges,
Surround the farms,
The form is slender,
And so are your arms.

Daisies are pretty,
Daffies have style,
My effect is dazzling,
And so is your smile.

A moonlight is beautiful,
Just like you.
