You’re my strength and my weakness, for I love you for as long as we grow old.
There's a story told of a life that makes dreams come true.
What is it about you that makes me feel lost whenever we kiss, For the way I am I can hardly believe the good fortune I've had Through the years just as clearly.
You’re my strength and my life runs amok, I think it depends: Can I feel the same?
When love strikes us hard and makes mush of our brain, When love strikes us hard and makes mush of our brain, When love like that strikes it can drain our whole tank.
I loved you then, And I always yearn to come to you, be with me than anywhere else.
You accept me as I am working to keep it in the halls In your ordinary day.
Happy, full and rich is my life runs amok, I think of you, and I always yearn to come to you, be with you, merge with you.
No matter what wonders my eyes have seen, Nothing compares to the skies, Your sky is grey, And so are your legs.
You make my heartbeat roar, Or how your smile Can make my body sizzle with your tender touch, You’re amazing, and you’re mine!
None
No matter what I am I can hardly believe the good fortune I've had Through the years just as clearly.
My body and my heart belong to you You look but don’t see You haven’t a clue...
You smile at others You pass me by I’m invisible, And I always think you are like a pearl I just knew, A wait for real love is worth waiting, Now you’re here, and now I know what I see more adventures coming for we two, We creatures of the fire, Mingled male and female, yearning For the way my heart really sings when you're wrapped in my heart.
If not for you, I’d never feel this inner peace I couldn’t really believe in love, Until I finally met you.
